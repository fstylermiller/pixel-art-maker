# Pixel Art Maker

In this exercise, you'll create your own pixel art maker which will allow a user to choose colors from a palette and then paint pixel art. The interface is completely up to you, but it could look something like this.

More specifically, your pixel art maker should allow a user to do the following.

1. Start with a blank canvas of pixels.
1. Select a brush color from a palette of colors.
1. Paint the pixels on the canvas using the brush color.
1. Repeat step 2.

Here's a development workflow that we recommend you use.

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Create a small, 2x2 grid canvas made up of white, square `div` tags with a border.
1. Add an event listener to each `div` so when clicked the background turns red.
1. Create a small palette of two colors (e.g. red and blue) below the canvas using more `div` tags.
1. Add an event listener to these `div` tags so when clicked the brush color is saved.
1. Expand the dimensions of the pixel canvas.
1. Expand the palette with more colors. (i.e. red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, gray, black, white, etc.)
1. Expand the palette with a brush color indicator.
1. Improve the look and feel of the canvas and color palette. Be careful not to break your program's behavior!

**TIP:** Check out [this handy tool](http://www.colors.commutercreative.com/grid/) to see a list of all the named colors in CSS.

### Bonus 1

Improve the mouse so it behaves like a real paintbrush. In other words, allow the user to paint by clicking and dragging across the canvas. For this, you'll need a combination of the `mousedown`, `mouseenter`, and `mouseup` events.

**TIP:** The [`mouseenter` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/mouseenter) doesn't bubble up the DOM tree.

### Bonus 2

Add a color picker which allows the user to select any brush color using the [`<input type="color">` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/color) and the [`change` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/change).

WHEN LOADING IN AN IMAGE
Please open the console, and find a small image (400x400 works best).
the program is working, the page freezes while the image is loading.

I am still refactoring this, and will soon be able to load large images in very quickly.

I made it 4x as fast after refactoring but it still takes a while.
